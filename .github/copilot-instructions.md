# Copilot Instructions

All project instructions, coding standards, working methodology, and conventions are in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) at the repository root. Read that file for the full context before starting any task.

This file exists so GitHub Copilot picks up this pointer automatically. `AGENTS.md` is the single source of truth shared by all agents (Claude Code, Codex, Copilot).
