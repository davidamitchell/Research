## Work Log

### 2026-03-02 — New backlog item (integrative-framework-agent-decision-making)

**Added:**

- `Research/backlog/2026-03-02-integrative-framework-agent-decision-making.md` — **high priority**. Integrative framework for agent decision-making. Covers: operationalising the DIKW (Data → Information → Knowledge → Wisdom) hierarchy in agentic systems; intent as a structured construct (goals, objectives, constraints, desired outcomes) and mechanisms for prioritising conflicting intents; catalogue of enterprise knowledge domains agents must integrate (regulations, government policy, organisational mission and values, BU strategy, technical/financial constraints, risk tolerance, policies, standards, guardrails, processes); conflict resolution mechanisms (precedence hierarchies, confidence-weighted arbitration, explainable justification traces); integration with memory architecture findings; alignment principles ensuring components reinforce intent-driven decisions; practical playbook for operationalising agents as decision-support systems. Depends on: `2026-03-02-agent-memory-management-context-injection.md` (memory architecture) and `2026-03-01-agent-lsp-policy-enforcement.md` (policy guardrails). Cross-references: DIKW literature (Ackoff 1989, Rowley 2007), Nonaka & Takeuchi SECI model, Simon bounded rationality, NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act, Constitutional AI, GraphRAG.

**Existing items cross-referenced (not duplicated):**
- `Research/backlog/2026-03-02-agent-memory-management-context-injection.md` — memory architecture dependency; findings to be integrated when complete
- `Research/completed/2026-03-01-agent-lsp-policy-enforcement.md` — prior findings on policy guardrails and governance enforcement

### 2026-03-02 — New backlog items (search, interaction, and distribution)

**Added:**

Four new backlog items covering the gaps in indexing/search improvements, interaction methods, and distribution of research results:

- `Research/backlog/2026-03-02-semantic-full-text-search.md` — **high priority**. Semantic and full-text search over the research corpus. Covers: SQLite FTS5 (BM25), hybrid BM25 + Model2Vec + sqlite-vec + RRF (following the pattern identified in `2026-03-01-context-mode-llm-context-compression.md`), CLI `research search` command, chunking strategy for research items, incremental hash-based re-indexing. Cross-references: `2026-02-27-indexing-and-tracking-method.md` (prior indexing decision; vector search explicitly deferred), `2026-02-27-local-database.md` (database options), `2026-03-01-context-mode-llm-context-compression.md` (hybrid retrieval pattern Key Finding 6).

- `Research/backlog/2026-03-02-chat-conversational-interface.md` — **high priority**. Conversational/chat interface for querying the research corpus. Covers: MCP server with `search_research` + `get_research_item` tools, GitHub Copilot extension approach, CLI chatbot wrapping the search layer, grounding and hallucination prevention, cross-reference navigation. Depends on: `2026-03-02-semantic-full-text-search.md` (search layer). Cross-references: `2026-02-27-interface-and-delivery.md` (upstream item; MCP mentioned but not designed), `2026-03-01-context-mode-llm-context-compression.md` (MCP server design pattern: compact summary + queryable store + drill-down tools).

- `Research/backlog/2026-03-02-slack-msteams-research-integration.md` — **medium priority**. Slack and MS Teams integration for research delivery and capture. Covers: outbound delivery via Incoming Webhooks (GitHub Actions step triggered by `Research/completed/**` push), digest mode (weekly summary), inbound capture via slash commands or Power Automate flows, query integration with the conversational interface. Note: new secrets (`SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` or `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL`) will require owner approval per AGENTS.md constraints. Cross-references: `2026-02-27-interface-and-delivery.md`, `2026-03-01-github-wiki-research-content.md` (same trigger pattern to reuse).

- `Research/backlog/2026-03-02-ios-shortcuts-research.md` — **medium priority**. iOS Shortcuts for research capture and query. Covers: Share Sheet shortcut to add a URL or title to the backlog (GitHub API direct file creation vs. issue creation), Siri hands-free dictation, wiki quick-access shortcut, search/query shortcut via `workflow_dispatch`. Authentication via fine-grained PAT in iOS Keychain. Cross-references: `2026-02-27-simple-process-for-adding-research-item.md` (existing capture paths; iOS Shortcuts is the missing third path), `2026-03-01-github-wiki-research-content.md` (wiki as readable iOS delivery channel).

**Existing items cross-referenced (not duplicated):**
- `Research/backlog/2026-02-27-interface-and-delivery.md` — broader interface question; new items are focused sub-topics
- `Research/backlog/2026-02-27-local-database.md` — database technology choice; `semantic-full-text-search` is the search UX layer on top
- `Research/backlog/2026-02-27-local-index-vs-reference.md` — storage policy; upstream of search
### 2026-03-02 — New research item (transaction-costs)

**Completed:**

- `Research/completed/2026-03-02-transaction-costs.md` — completed; structured findings covering: Coase (1937, 1960) — firm as transaction-cost-minimising institution, the Coase Theorem; Williamson (1975, 1985) — asset specificity, uncertainty, frequency as transaction dimensions, governance-structure choice (market / hybrid / hierarchy), bounded rationality and opportunism; North (1990) — institutions as "rules of the game", path dependence in institutional change; Ostrom (1990) — 8 design principles for commons governance, polycentric governance; Munger — politics as a transaction-cost environment. Speculative integration: SWE (make-vs-buy as Williamson governance choice, code review transaction costs, specification as incomplete contract), AI agent design (single-agent firm vs multi-agent market, Ostrom's principles for agent memory, North's path dependence in training distributions), knowledge management (documentation as commons, Ostrom design principles for wikis, informal vs formal institutions), context engineering (Coase Theorem restated for context construction, asset specificity of session context, RAG/memory/full-context as market/hybrid/hierarchy governance choice, Munger political lens on system-prompt control).

### 2026-03-02 — New backlog item (agent-memory-management-context-injection)

**Added:**

- `Research/backlog/2026-03-02-agent-memory-management-context-injection.md` — new high-priority backlog item. Covers the full landscape of agent memory architectures beyond RAG: latency trade-offs, knowledge scoping (session/team/repo/role/task), governance and provenance, quality testing, distribution of recall tooling, and the "ungardened wiki" failure mode. Systems surveyed include MemGPT/Letta, Zep, Mem0, LangMem, Cognee/Graphiti, and GraphRAG.
### 2026-03-02 — Session 15 (GitHub wiki publishing — W-0030)

**Completed:**

Research item:
- `Research/completed/2026-03-01-github-wiki-research-content.md` — completed; findings establish: GitHub wiki is a separate git repo (`{repo}.wiki.git`); `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `contents: write` is sufficient (no PAT); pages are flat (no subdirectories); `Home.md`, `_Sidebar.md`, `_Footer.md` are the navigation primitives; full-rebuild approach (delete all pages, regenerate) is correct at current volume; YAML front-matter must be stripped before publishing.

Implementation (W-0030):
- `src/wiki/__init__.py` — wiki module init
- `src/wiki/publish.py` — `load_frontmatter`, `strip_frontmatter`, `page_name`, `generate_home`, `generate_sidebar`, `publish`; full-rebuild approach; callable as `python -m src.wiki.publish <completed_dir> <wiki_dir>`
- `.github/workflows/publish-wiki.yml` — triggers on push to `main` (paths: `Research/completed/**`) and `workflow_dispatch`; checks out wiki with `GITHUB_TOKEN`; runs publish script; commits and pushes
- `tests/test_wiki.py` — 24 tests covering all functions and integration
- `BACKLOG.md` — W-0030 added as done
- `PROGRESS.md` — updated

**Setup required:** Owner must enable the wiki once via repository Settings → Features → Wikis before the first workflow push will succeed.

### 2026-03-02 — Research Loop (simple-process-for-adding-research-item)

**Completed:**

Research item:
- `Research/completed/2026-02-27-simple-process-for-adding-research-item.md` — completed; two capture paths identified: `python -m src.main research add "<title>"` (already implemented) for agents, and a GitHub issue form + Actions workflow for the owner who operates via GitHub website/iOS app only. The Zettelkasten capture-first principle validates deferring all metadata except title to the start step.

### 2026-03-02 — Research Loop (research-backlog-vs-repo-improvement-backlog)

**Completed:**

Research item:
- `Research/completed/2026-02-27-research-backlog-vs-repo-improvement-backlog.md` — completed; two-location file system separation (`Research/backlog/` + `BACKLOG.md`) confirmed as the correct design for keeping research questions separate from repo improvement work. Convention is documented at three levels: file system location, header notes in each file, and AGENTS.md Non-Negotiable Constraints. Cross-reference mechanism flows one-way via the `output: [backlog-item]` field.

- https://github.com/davidamitchell/Latest-developments-/blob/main/BACKLOG.md (comparison: single-type backlog in a pipeline repo)

### 2026-03-02 — Research Loop (information-synthesis-entropy)

**Completed:**

Research item:
- `Research/completed/2026-02-27-information-synthesis-entropy.md` — completed; three-stage synthesis pipeline recommended: entropy-guided extraction → semantic deduplication → Chain of Density prompting. Shannon entropy, Information Bottleneck, and MDL all converge on the same principle: discard the predictable, preserve the novel. GraphRAG is the right architecture for multi-source synthesis at scale; CoD prompting is the immediately implementable technique.

### 2026-03-02 — Session 14 (Research loop safety controls + COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN)

**Completed:**

- W-0029: Added runaway loop safety controls to `.github/workflows/research-loop.yml`:
  - Renamed secret `GH_TOKEN` → `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` (owner confirmed secret is set with this name)
  - Added `timeout-minutes: 90` hard ceiling on the job
  - Changed `max_items` from free-text to constrained dropdown (choices 1–5)
  - Added `HARD_MAX_ITERATIONS=10` shell guard (independent of `max_items`)
  - Added consecutive-failure abort (`FAILURE_THRESHOLD=2`)
  - Added 30-second inter-iteration sleep (`INTER_ITERATION_SLEEP=30`)
  - Added `set -euo pipefail` for fail-fast shell behaviour
- `tests/test_research_loop.py`: 25 tests proving workflow structure, safety controls, prompt content, backlog counting logic, and end-to-end loop cycle
- `docs/adr/0004-autonomous-research-loop.md`: ADR documenting design decisions, safety controls, and rejected alternatives (Claude Code CLI, unlimited `max_items`, PR-per-item model)
- `docs/adr/README.md`: ADR index updated with ADR-0004
- `AGENTS.md`: Updated credentials table (`COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`), research loop docs, safety controls summary
- `BACKLOG.md`: W-0029 added as done

### 2026-03-02 — Session 13 (GitHub Specify / Ralph loop / Lisa planning research)

**Completed:**

Research item:
- `Research/completed/2026-03-01-github-specify-ralph-loop-lisa-planning.md` — completed; structured findings covering: Ralph Wiggum Technique origin (Geoffrey Huntley, July 2025, viral Dec 2025); three-phase workflow (Specify→Plan→Build); spec format (one Markdown per Topic of Concern, "one sentence without and" test); context management discipline (one task per loop, 40-60% smart zone, main agent as scheduler + subagents for expensive work); back-pressure as proof (tests/lint must pass before commit; dual-condition exit gate in frankbria implementation); Lisa as planning + persistent memory archetype solving the Groundhog Day Problem (knowledge graph via Graphiti + MCP + Neo4j, Claude Code hooks for session-start/stop extraction); GitHub Copilot Agent mode as the practical entry point for this repo's owner (issue assignment → draft PR, no local shell needed); evolutionary framing (Ralph = (1,1) evolutionary strategy, LLM mutation, tests as fitness); active inference structural equivalence (spec = prior, test result = observation, loop = action until surprise = 0)

Sources consulted:
- https://ghuntley.com/ralph/ (primary source — Geoffrey Huntley's original article)
- https://github.com/ClaytonFarr/ralph-playbook (community playbook with detailed loop mechanics)
- https://github.com/frankbria/ralph-claude-code (Claude Code implementation with dual-condition exit gate, v0.11.5)

- https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-meet-the-new-coding-agent/ (Copilot coding agent announcement)

**Key insight for this repo:** This repo's `AGENTS.md` + `.github/skills/` + `tests/` + `pyproject.toml` already satisfies the Ralph prerequisites. The only gaps are `specs/` folder (specs per JTBD topic), `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (task list), and `loop.sh` (outer bash loop). For the GitHub-only owner, Copilot Agent mode (assign detailed issue → Copilot opens draft PR) is the practical entry point — no local shell or `--dangerously-skip-permissions` required.

### 2026-03-01 — Session 12 (Context Mode research)

**Completed:**

Research item:
- `Research/completed/2026-03-01-context-mode-llm-context-compression.md` — completed; structured findings covering: the two-sided context consumption problem (Cloudflare Code Mode for definitions vs Context Mode for outputs); Context Mode's architecture (sandboxed subprocess execution, SQLite FTS5 + BM25 knowledge base, subagent routing, progressive search throttling); quantified compression ratios (315 KB → 5.4 KB, 98% reduction; sessions from ~30 min to ~3 hours); the hard architectural boundary — Context Mode cannot intercept MCP tool responses (JSON-RPC bypass, no PostToolUse hook, empirically confirmed by HN commenter); BM25 limitation for structured tool output and hybrid retrieval improvement (Model2Vec + sqlite-vec + FTS5 + RRF); prompt cache preservation argument; broader context management frontier (backtracking, context trees, subprocess isolation, agentic self-management)

Sources consulted:
- https://mksg.lu/blog/context-mode (primary article)
- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47193064 (HN discussion, empirical MCP interception test)
- https://github.com/mksglu/claude-context-mode (GitHub README, architecture detail)
- https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-mode-mcp/ (Code Mode input-side compression reference)

**Key insight for this repo:** This repo uses 10 MCP servers. Context Mode cannot intercept any of their outputs — MCP responses (filesystem, memory, git, arxiv, etc.) go directly to model context via JSON-RPC. For Claude Code sessions on this repo, output compression requires server-side implementation in each MCP server or reliance on built-in tool compression only.
### 2026-03-01 — Session 12 (new backlog item — agent LSP policy enforcement)

**Completed:**

- `Research/backlog/2026-03-01-agent-lsp-policy-enforcement.md` — research item on guiding headless autonomous agents via LSP-like mechanisms for org policy conformance (security, architectural, engineering standards); key focus: identifying the "LSAP"/"LASP" acronym and protocol, surveying whether headless agents can act as LSP clients, mapping the gap between CI/pre-commit gates and in-loop real-time feedback; priority high
### 2026-03-01 — Session 12 (GitHub wiki backlog item)

**Completed:**

- `Research/backlog/2026-03-01-github-wiki-research-content.md` — new backlog item: researching how to publish completed research items to the GitHub wiki for easier reading on the GitHub website and iOS app. Covers: GitHub wiki constraints, publish pipeline design (Actions workflow, front-matter stripping, index generation), incremental vs full-rebuild approach, and navigation structure (tag index, date-sorted, topic groups). Priority: medium. Output types: tool, knowledge, backlog-item.
### 2026-03-01 — Session 12 (Research backlog item — GitHub Specify / Ralph loops / Lisa planning)

**Completed:**

Research items:
- `Research/backlog/2026-03-01-github-specify-ralph-loop-lisa-planning.md` — added backlog item covering: GitHub's "Specify" concept (spec-first AI development), the Ralph Wiggum Technique (autonomous implementation loop), Lisa planning (planning subagent pattern), proof-driven development as the unifying methodology, and the connection to active inference / free energy minimisation. Approach decomposes into six sub-questions; seven primary sources identified (ghuntley/how-to-ralph-wiggum, ClaytonFarr/ralph-playbook, frankbria/ralph-claude-code, Geoffrey Huntley writing, GitHub Copilot Agent docs, GitHub blog).

---

### 2026-03-01 — Session 11 (Tavily MCP integration)

**Completed:**

- `.mcp.json` — added `tavily` server entry (`npx -y tavily-mcp@latest`, `TAVILY_API_KEY` env var)
- `.github/mcp.json` — added `tavily` server entry (same, with `type: "stdio"`)
- `.env.example` — added `TAVILY_API_KEY=tvly-...` entry under Search section
- `AGENTS.md` — Server Reference table: added `tavily` row (10 servers now); updated session-start availability table to include `tavily` in unavailable list for cloud/Copilot runner and in "missing secrets" list for local dev; updated substitutions note (`brave_search` / `tavily` → built-in web search); added `tavily` to "Using MCP in research tasks" section with guidance on when to prefer it over `brave_search` (extracted content vs links)

Tavily MCP provides: `tavily-search` (real-time web search), `tavily-extract` (content extraction from URLs), `tavily-map` (structured site map), `tavily-crawl` (systematic site crawl). Requires `TAVILY_API_KEY` repository secret.

---

### 2026-03-01 — Session 10 (Issue consolidation — Group A: #11, #12, #13)

**Completed:**

Group A — AGENTS.md + config improvements (all changes in one PR per consolidation recommendation):

- `.mcp.json` and `.github/mcp.json` — replaced hardcoded `/workspaces/Research` filesystem path with `"."` (current working directory); works across Codespaces, agent runners, and local dev without env var config (#11, Bug 1)
- `AGENTS.md` — Repository Layout section: added `Research/transcripts/` (fetch-transcript workflow output) and `state/` (StateStore JSON file) entries (#13, Gap 4)
- `AGENTS.md` — Agent Skills section: expanded table to include per-agent invocation column (Claude Code slash commands vs Copilot by-reference); added submodule setup note (`git submodule update --init`); added Skills Invocation section covering Claude Code, Copilot, and fallback behaviour (#12)
- `AGENTS.md` — MCP server table: replaced "Codespaces secret" with "repository secret or `.env`" for `brave_search` and `github` (#11, Bug 2)
- `AGENTS.md` — MCP section: added Session-start MCP availability check section with per-environment availability table and substitution guide (#11, Bug 3)
- `AGENTS.md` — MCP "Using MCP in research tasks": removed Codespaces-specific language; updated filesystem note to reflect `"."` path (#11)
- `AGENTS.md` — Mini-Retro section: added feedback loop steps — update AGENTS.md, add BACKLOG.md item, record in PROGRESS.md (#13, Gap 1)
- `AGENTS.md` — Added "When to Update AGENTS.md" section (new) (#13, Gap 3)
- `AGENTS.md` — Added "When the Backlog Is Empty" section (new) (#13, Gap 2)
- `README.md` — added `git submodule update --init` to Quick Start (#12)

Issues closed or addressed:
- #10 — already closed (incorporated into #11); confirmed
- #11 — all three bugs fixed
- #12 — all four problems addressed (README setup step, invocation section, agent-specific notes, fallback instruction)
- #13 — all four gaps addressed (Mini-Retro loop, empty-backlog protocol, update trigger, directory layout)

**Remaining (Group B — separate PR to `davidamitchell/Skills`):**
- #8 — Research skill improvements (7 gaps identified post AI strategy research)
- #9 — Strategy-author skill improvements (7 gaps identified)

These require changes to the `davidamitchell/Skills` repository and cannot be addressed in this repo's PR.

### 2026-02-28 — Session 9 (AI Strategy research)

**Completed:**

Research items:
- `Research/completed/2026-02-28-ai-strategy.md` — completed; structured findings covering: global AI strategy survey (8 common pillars, six jurisdictions); NZ "Investing with Confidence" strategy (July 2025, MBIE-led, light-touch, $76B GDP estimate); NZ agency landscape (MBIE, DIA, RBNZ, Privacy Commissioner — fragmented, no single AI regulator); NZ political positions (National-led: pro-growth light-touch; Labour: cautious rights-based; Greens: strong safeguards); NZ case law status (thin — Wikeley v Kea Investments [2024] NZCA 609; no binding case on automated government decisions); policy framework comparison (EU AI Act / NIST AI RMF / ISO 42001 / DORA); use-case typology (4 types: augmentation → fully agentic BUs); exploit/explore strategic framing

New backlog items added:
- `Research/backlog/2026-02-28-ai-strategy-business-efficiency-examples.md` — examples of AI strategies focused on business efficiency outcomes
- `Research/backlog/2026-02-28-ai-strategy-swe-focus.md` — AI strategies targeting software engineering productivity
- `Research/backlog/2026-02-28-ai-strategy-risk-reduction-focus.md` — AI strategies with risk reduction as primary objective
- `Research/backlog/2026-02-28-ai-strategy-security-focus.md` — AI strategies focused on security (AI-enhanced threats + AI system security)
- `Research/backlog/2026-02-28-rbnz-ai-supervisory-expectations.md` — RBNZ's specific AI supervisory stance and gap analysis vs comparators
- `Research/backlog/2026-02-28-exploit-explore-ai-portfolio-framework.md` — practical decision framework for exploit vs explore AI portfolio classification
- `Research/backlog/2026-02-28-ai-control-testing-and-assurance.md` — AI automating control testing, control gap identification, and policies/standards reviews; vendor and regulatory landscape
- `Research/backlog/2026-02-28-ai-line-1-line-2-risk-agents.md` — who is building line 1 and line 2 risk agents; architecture, governance, and accountability patterns

GitHub issues raised:
- Issue #8: Research skill retro and improvement suggestions (post AI strategy research)
- Issue #9: Strategy-author skill improvement suggestions
- Issue #10: MCP servers unavailable in agent environment (brave_search, arxiv, filesystem, memory, sequential_thinking)
- Skills submodules re-initialised (`git submodule update --init`); research, strategy-author, and remove-ai-slop skills applied
- MCP servers (brave_search, arxiv, filesystem, sequential_thinking, memory) not available in this agent environment; web_search used as substitute
- Raised GitHub issues for MCP availability gaps

**Notes:**
- All outputs reviewed against remove-ai-slop skill: predictable transitions removed, structural variety applied, alignment padding eliminated, direct declarative language used throughout
- Research skill methodology applied: recursive decomposition, evidence sufficiency check, consistency loop, multi-lens analysis (technical, regulatory, economic, political, behavioural)

### 2026-02-28 — Session 8 (Epic 3 implementation — W-0021, W-0022)

**Completed:**

- `src/state.py` — `StateStore` class:
  - `is_processed(url)` — O(1) lookup in in-memory dict
  - `record(item)` — stores `fetched_at`, `title`, `source_id`; writes atomically via `tempfile.mkstemp` + `os.replace`
  - `processed_urls()` — returns full set of processed URLs
  - Corrupt / missing state file is handled gracefully (starts empty, logs warning)
- `src/main.py` — `_fetch_youtube` now instantiates `StateStore`, skips already-processed URLs (`[skip]` message), records new items after printing
- `tests/test_state.py` — 12 tests: empty store, load existing, corrupt file, is_processed, record (disk + dir creation + multiple + overwrite), round-trip reload
- `BACKLOG.md` — W-0021 and W-0022 marked done
- `PROGRESS.md` — Epic 3 status: Done (3/3 slices)

Research items:
- `Research/completed/2026-02-28-jevons-paradox.md` — completed; structured findings covering: Jevons (1865) coal/steam mechanics; historical sector evidence (lighting, automobiles, computing); counter-examples (CFCs, leaded petrol, saturated markets); current AI coding commentary (Proxify, MomoView, Kamiwaza); speculative 1/5/10-year framework for code production (explicitly labelled as inference/speculation)
- `Research/completed/2026-02-28-predictive-processing-active-inference.md` — completed; findings covering: Rao & Ballard (1999) bidirectional cortical model; Clark (2016) PP thesis; active inference as prediction fulfillment; precision weighting as attention; Friston's FEP — empirical status (well-supported as modelling toolkit; contested as grand unified theory); falsifiability objection; applications in computational psychiatry and AI

**Notes:**
- 68 tests pass; `make check` clean
- `python -m src.main fetch youtube --video <url>` now deduplicates automatically; re-running shows `[skip]` for each already-processed item

---



**Completed:**

Research items:
- `Research/completed/2026-02-27-indexing-and-tracking-method.md` — completed; findings recommend JSON state file (`state/index.json`) for URL-based deduplication + YAML front-matter for item metadata; SQLite and vector stores deferred with clear migration trigger criteria

System improvements:
- `docs/adr/0003-indexing-and-tracking-approach.md` — ADR documenting the chosen approach, rejected alternatives, and migration trigger; unblocks Epic 3
- `docs/adr/README.md` — index updated
- `BACKLOG.md` — W-0020 marked done
- `PROGRESS.md` — Epic 3 status updated to "In Progress (1/3 slices)"

**MCP/Skills status:**
- Skills submodules initialized via `git submodule update --init`; `research` skill read and applied for evidence gathering and synthesis structure
- `web_search` used for research (analogous to `brave_search` MCP); `web_fetch` available
- `brave_search`, `arxiv`, `filesystem`, `sequential_thinking`, and `memory` MCP servers are not available in this agent environment (no Codespaces, no API keys); noted below in Next Steps

**Notes:**
- Epic 3 (indexing) is now unblocked: W-0021 (implement JSON state) and W-0022 (dedup logic) can proceed
- Skills submodules require `git submodule update --init` after a fresh clone in this CI environment; they are not auto-initialized

---

### 2026-02-27 — Session 1

**Completed:**
- `README.md` — updated with project description and quick start
- `AGENTS.md` — comprehensive agent instructions adapted from `davidamitchell/Latest-developments-`; research-specific workflow (add/start/complete items), output types, skills table, MCP config notes
- `BACKLOG.md` — repo improvement backlog, separate from research item backlog

### 2026-02-28 — Session 2 (kickoff backlog work)

**Completed:**

Epic 1 — Research Item Process (W-0011 to W-0015):
- `src/research/cli.py` — `add`, `list`, `start`, `complete` commands
- `src/main.py` — wired research and fetch sub-commands
- `tests/test_research_cli.py` — full test coverage of all CLI commands

Epic 2 — YouTube Transcript Fetcher (W-0016 to W-0019):
- `src/fetchers/youtube.py` — `YouTubeFetcher` implementing the `Fetcher` protocol; supports channel feeds and individual video URLs; transcript fallback to description
- `src/config.py` — `load_config()` with schema validation for all sections
- `config/sources.yaml` — updated schema: `youtube.channels` + `youtube.videos`; added `https://youtu.be/HYUoS0GkGCs` as first video to process
- `tests/test_fetchers_youtube.py` — 15 tests with all network calls mocked
- `tests/test_config.py` — 9 tests for config loading and validation

Research items:
- `Research/backlog/2026-02-28-youtube-video-HYUoS0GkGCs-concepts.md` — research item for the video

**Notes:**
- 52 tests pass, `make check` clean
- `python -m src.main fetch youtube --video https://youtu.be/HYUoS0GkGCs` is the command to pull the transcript (requires network access to YouTube)
- Epic 3 (indexing) is blocked until `Research/backlog/2026-02-27-indexing-and-tracking-method.md` is completed

### 2026-02-28 — Session 6 (skills submodules — W-0026)

**Completed:**

- `.github/skills` — git submodule properly initialised, pointing to `davidamitchell/Skills` at `7095c41e842f036e2241ad9ae3aa1360db04be83` (latest)
- `.claude/skills` — same submodule added for Claude Code
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` — thin stub pointing to `AGENTS.md` (matches `Latest-developments-` pattern)
- `docs/adr/0002-agent-skills-submodule.md` — ADR documenting the submodule decision
- `docs/adr/README.md` — index updated
- `BACKLOG.md` — W-0026 added and marked done

**Root cause of the gap:** The `.gitmodules` file was created manually in Session 1 (the entries were written as plain text) but `git submodule add` was never run, so no gitlink entries were committed into the tree. The skill directories did not exist and agents had no access to the skill files.

**Notes:**
- `sync-skills.yml` already handles both submodule paths — no changes needed there
- `AGENTS.md` already documents both submodule paths and the skills table correctly — no changes needed
- Weekly Monday sync will keep both pointers current without manual intervention

### 2026-02-28 — Session 5 (AI Strategy backlog item — government/opposition coverage)

**Completed:**

Research items:
- `Research/backlog/2026-02-28-ai-strategy.md` — enhanced to explicitly cover NZ current government (National-led coalition) and opposition (Labour, Green Party) AI policy positions; added Approach step 3 and corresponding source entry

---

### 2026-02-28 — Session 4 (AI Strategy backlog item)

**Completed:**

Research items:
- `Research/backlog/2026-02-28-ai-strategy.md` — AI strategy research item covering global/NZ examples, NZ regulatory and policy landscape (RBNZ, DIA, MBIE, PNZ), relevant case law, policy frameworks and categorisation schemas, DORA AI capability model, use-case typology (augmentation → agentic BUs), and the exploit vs explore distinction

---

### 2026-02-28 — Session 3 (Jevons Paradox backlog item)

**Completed:**

Research items:
- `Research/backlog/2026-02-28-jevons-paradox.md` — deep-dive on Jevons Paradox mechanics, historical sector examples, counter-examples, current SWE/code-cost commentary, and a 1/5/10-year speculative framework

System improvements:
- `AGENTS.md` — added explicit "Update PROGRESS.md" step to the Research Item Workflow (add/start/complete) so agents cannot skip it
- `Research/README.md` — same update to the quick-command workflow section

---

## Next Steps

1. Run `python -m src.main fetch youtube --video https://youtu.be/HYUoS0GkGCs` in a networked environment to pull the transcript
2. Extract concepts from the transcript and create per-concept deep-dive research items
3. Complete each concept research item, then synthesise findings back in `2026-02-28-youtube-video-HYUoS0GkGCs-concepts.md`
4. Epic 3 — decide on indexing approach once the indexing research item is completed
