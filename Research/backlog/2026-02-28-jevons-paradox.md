# Jevons Paradox: efficiency gains, demand rebound, and the falling cost of software production

## Research Question

How does Jevons Paradox operate across different sectors historically, what are the conditions under which cost or efficiency improvements *do not* increase total demand, and what do current thinkers predict for the software engineering and code-production market as the marginal cost of producing code falls rapidly toward zero?

## Scope

**In scope:**
- Mechanics of Jevons Paradox: the original coal/steam-engine observation, the rebound effect, and the conditions that amplify or suppress it
- Historical sector case studies: energy (lighting, transport, computing), manufacturing, agriculture, water use, and at least one non-energy sector
- Counter-examples: cases where efficiency improvements reduced or stabilised total demand rather than expanding it (e.g. CFC refrigerants, leaded petrol, asbestos — retirement through substitution/regulation; or saturation markets)
- Current published and speculative commentary on decreasing cost of SWE/code production: who is making predictions, what mechanisms they invoke, and whether they explicitly reference Jevons
- Personal speculative framework: what might happen at 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year horizons for software engineering as a profession and an economic activity

**Out of scope:**
- Detailed technical modelling of elasticity (regression-level economics)
- Policy prescription for energy markets (only as examples to test the mechanism)
- Detailed labour-economics treatment of automation more broadly (keep focus on code production)

**Constraints:** Primary interest is mechanistic understanding and forward speculation, not econometric precision. Prioritise clear, well-sourced historical examples; clearly flag all forward speculation as such per speculation-control conventions.

## Context

The marginal cost of producing functional code is falling sharply as AI coding assistants improve. This mirrors historical cases where resource or production costs fell dramatically. Jevons Paradox predicts that efficiency gains that reduce the cost of a resource or activity tend to *increase*, not decrease, total consumption of that resource. Understanding whether — and under what conditions — this dynamic applies to software production matters for forecasting the future demand for software engineers, the scale of software being built, and the economic and social consequences of ubiquitous cheap code.

## Approach

1. **Core mechanics** — Read the original 1865 Jevons argument and at least one modern economic treatment of the rebound effect. Distinguish direct rebound (same use, more of it), indirect rebound (money saved spent elsewhere), and economy-wide (macro) rebound.
2. **Sector deep-dive** — Compile at least six historical examples across different sectors, documenting: the efficiency gain, the expected reduction in consumption, and the actual observed change in consumption.
3. **Counter-examples** — Identify cases where efficiency improvements *did not* produce a demand rebound and characterise what structural factors suppressed the paradox (saturation, substitution, regulation, low income elasticity, etc.).
4. **SWE / code-production commentary** — Survey who is writing or speaking about falling code costs and Jevons-style dynamics; capture their predictions and the mechanisms they propose.
5. **Speculative framework** — Synthesise the above into a personal 1/5/10-year forecast, clearly labelled as speculation, anchored to the historical pattern.
