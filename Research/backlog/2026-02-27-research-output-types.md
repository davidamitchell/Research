# Research output types: skills, tools, agents, knowledge

## Question / Hypothesis

What are the possible output types from a research item, and how should each type be handled, stored, and acted upon?

## Context

Not all research has the same output. A research item might produce:
- A **skill** to add to `davidamitchell/Skills` (reusable agent instruction)
- A **tool** to add to `src/` (code that can be run)
- An **agent** configuration or prompt
- A piece of **knowledge** (ADR, structured note, updated README)
- A new **backlog item** in `BACKLOG.md` (the research revealed work to do)

Understanding the output taxonomy helps write better research items and ensures the output actually gets used.

## Scope

**In scope:**
- Defining the output types and their handling conventions
- Where each output type is stored
- How to link a research item to its output

**Out of scope:**
- Implementation of any specific output type

## Approach

1. Review existing output categories in `davidamitchell/Skills` and `davidamitchell/Latest-developments-`
2. Draft output type taxonomy
3. Update `Research/_template.md` and `Research/README.md` with the taxonomy
4. Consider whether additional output types are needed (e.g. "dataset", "prompt template")

## Sources

- [ ] `davidamitchell/Skills` repo — existing skill categories
- [ ] `AGENTS.md` — current output type list

## Findings

*(Fill in when completing. Follow the research skill synthesis structure.)*

### Executive Summary

3–5 sentences. What is the answer to the research question? State the key conclusion directly.

### Key Findings

Ordered list. Each finding is a specific, evidence-backed claim.

1.
2.

### Evidence Map

| Claim | Source | Confidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| | | high / medium / low | |

### Assumptions

Explicit assumptions made during the investigation and the justification for each.

- **Assumption:** ... **Justification:** ...

### Analysis

How the evidence was weighed, what trade-offs were identified, and how competing interpretations were resolved.

### Risks, Gaps, and Uncertainties

What is still unknown? Where does the evidence fall short? What could change the conclusion?

-

### Open Questions

Questions that surfaced during research but are out of scope for this item. Each may become a new backlog item.
