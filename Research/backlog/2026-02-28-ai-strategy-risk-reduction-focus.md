# AI Strategy Examples: Risk Reduction Focus

## Research Question

Which organisations have developed AI strategies explicitly framed around risk reduction — operational risk, credit risk, fraud, compliance, model risk — and what governance structures, outcome metrics, and failure modes characterise successful implementations?

## Scope

**In scope:**
- Organisations where AI's primary strategic role is risk identification, prevention, or mitigation (not merely a risk that must be managed)
- Key risk domains: credit risk (loan default prediction), fraud detection, AML/KYC compliance, operational risk (failure prediction, anomaly detection), model risk management for AI systems themselves
- Regulatory frameworks relevant to risk-reducing AI: RBNZ BS11/BS2A, APRA CPS 230, DORA, OCC model risk guidance (SR 11-7), Basel III/IV AI implications
- Governance structures for AI risk models: validation, monitoring, explainability requirements
- NZ financial sector context: RBNZ supervised entities

**Out of scope:**
- AI as a general risk (ethical risks, existential risks, safety risks) — not the topic here
- AI risk management frameworks as compliance exercises (covered by EU AI Act / NIST RMF research)
- Security-specific AI applications — see separate backlog item

**Constraints:** Focus on risk reduction as strategic objective, not as compliance checkbox.

## Context

The AI strategy research item (completed 2026-02-28) identified DORA and RBNZ as key frameworks for NZ financial institutions but found that RBNZ has not published standalone AI supervisory expectations. Risk-reducing AI is a primary use case in financial services globally; understanding the strategy and governance models for this application type directly informs what NZ financial institutions should be designing.

Type 3 (delegated authority agents) in the four-type typology is most prevalent in risk management: AI making credit decisions, flagging fraud, or escalating compliance exceptions. The governance architecture for these systems is the primary unresolved question.

## Approach

1. **Survey published cases** — identify 6–8 financial services or utilities organisations that have deployed AI specifically for risk reduction with disclosed governance approach and outcomes.
2. **Regulatory expectation mapping** — for each relevant regulator (RBNZ, APRA, OCC, ECB), document what supervisory expectations exist for AI in risk management contexts.
3. **Model risk management** — document how SR 11-7 (US) model risk management principles are being adapted for AI/ML models specifically (the original guidance predates neural networks).
4. **Failure mode analysis** — identify cases where AI risk models failed or produced adverse outcomes. What went wrong and what governance would have caught it?
5. **NZ applicability** — which frameworks and case studies are directly applicable to RBNZ-supervised institutions? What does RBNZ's current silence on AI-specific guidance mean in practice?
