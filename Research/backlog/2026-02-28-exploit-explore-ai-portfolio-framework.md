# Exploit vs Explore: A Decision Framework for AI Portfolio Planning

## Research Question

How should organisations distinguish between exploitation and exploration AI investments in practice, and what diagnostic criteria and portfolio tools enable that distinction to be applied at budget and roadmap planning level?

## Scope

**In scope:**
- March (1991) exploit/explore framework applied specifically to AI portfolio planning
- Existing portfolio tools for balancing exploitation and exploration (e.g., McKinsey three-horizon model, Reeves contextual strategy, ambidextrous organisation design)
- Signals that should trigger a shift from exploitation to exploration mode (performance plateau, competitive disruption, new AI capability emergence)
- Practical criteria for classifying an AI initiative as exploit vs explore at the point of investment decision
- Case studies where the exploit/explore distinction changed investment outcomes

**Out of scope:**
- Theoretical extensions of March (1991) beyond their planning utility
- Reinforcement learning explore/exploit trade-off (different domain)
- General innovation portfolio management unconnected to AI

**Constraints:** Must produce an actionable diagnostic tool or classification framework, not just theoretical analysis.

## Context

The AI strategy research item (completed 2026-02-28) identified the exploit/explore distinction as the most important strategic framing device missing from NZ's current policy discourse. Most NZ AI investment is in exploitation mode (efficiency, cost reduction) — the "competency trap" risk is that organisations optimise for today's operating model while competitors use exploration to redefine the competitive terrain.

A decision framework that helps senior leaders classify AI investments and manage portfolio balance would have immediate practical value for NZ organisations navigating this.

## Approach

1. Review and synthesise the exploit/explore literature beyond March (1991): Levinthal & March (1993), Benner & Tushman (2003), Raisch & Birkinshaw (2008) on ambidexterity
2. Survey existing AI portfolio frameworks (three-horizon, Gartner hype cycle investment guidance, BCG AI portfolio models)
3. Derive classification criteria: what observable features of an AI initiative indicate exploit vs explore?
4. Design a decision tool: a simple diagnostic framework applicable at investment review
5. Test against 3–4 real AI investment examples from the research corpus
