# AI Strategy Examples: Business Efficiency Focus

## Research Question

Which published AI strategies — corporate, national, or sector-specific — are explicitly designed around business efficiency as the primary objective, what measurable outcomes have they produced, and what design choices distinguish effective efficiency-focused AI programmes from those that underperform?

## Scope

**In scope:**
- Published corporate AI strategies where efficiency (cost reduction, throughput improvement, error reduction, cycle time) is the stated primary driver
- National or sector strategies where economic productivity is the dominant justification
- Case studies with at least one quantified outcome (cost saved, FTE equivalent, throughput gain)
- Industries where efficiency gains are well-documented: financial services, manufacturing, logistics, agriculture, healthcare administration
- Patterns across successful programmes: governance structures, build vs buy choices, data readiness, change management approaches

**Out of scope:**
- AI strategies where exploration (new business models, new markets) is the primary driver — see separate backlog item
- Theoretical frameworks without evidence of implementation
- Cases with no accessible outcome data

**Constraints:** Prioritise cases with independently verified or audited outcomes. Flag self-reported savings with lower confidence.

## Context

NZ's AI Strategy "Investing with Confidence" (July 2025) projects $76B in GDP uplift by 2038, with efficiency as the dominant near-term mechanism. Understanding what distinguishes successful efficiency-focused deployments from those that fail to realise projected gains is directly relevant to evaluating whether NZ's strategy is grounded in achievable assumptions.

The AI strategy research item (completed 2026-02-28) found that most NZ organisations are currently in exploitation mode — using AI to extract value from known patterns. This backlog item surfaces the evidence base for what that looks like when it works and when it does not.

## Approach

1. **Survey published cases** — identify 8–12 corporate or government programmes where efficiency was the explicit primary objective and outcomes were published or independently reported.
2. **Extract design variables** — for each case: industry, AI type (Type 1–4 in the four-type typology), deployment model (build/buy/partner), data readiness approach, change management method, time to value, and outcome metric.
3. **Pattern analysis** — identify common success factors and failure modes across cases.
4. **NZ relevance filter** — assess which patterns are applicable to NZ-scale organisations (typically smaller, less data-rich than the global cases).
5. **Efficiency ceiling analysis** — what are the known limits of efficiency-focused AI deployment? When does efficiency-mode AI investment face diminishing returns?
