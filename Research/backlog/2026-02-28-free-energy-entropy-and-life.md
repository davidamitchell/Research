# Free energy, entropy, and life: why organisms predict — from Schrödinger to Friston to Seth

## Research Question

Why do living organisms need predictive brains? What is the precise relationship between the thermodynamic concept of entropy (disorder), the information-theoretic concept of free energy (surprise), Karl Friston's free energy principle, and Anil Seth's claim that consciousness is the subjective instrument of life's war against entropy?

## Background / Trigger

In the Anil Seth Essentia Foundation synthesis (completed 2026-02-28), Key Finding 11 documents a point largely absent from the main talk's treatment but central to Seth's full framework as articulated in *Being You* (2021) and the Quanta Magazine interview (September 2021):

> *"I have to actively resist the second law of thermodynamics, so I don't dissipate into all kinds of states. The free-energy principle is not itself a theory about consciousness, but I think it's very relevant because it provides a way of understanding how and why brains work the way they do, and it links back to the idea that consciousness and life are very tightly related."*
> — Anil Seth, Quanta Magazine (2021)

The claim is: **life persists by occupying a vanishingly small subset of all physically possible states** (e.g., body temperature within ~2°C of 37°C, blood pH within 0.1 of 7.4). Anything outside that band means death. Living systems must *actively resist entropy* — the thermodynamic tendency toward disorder — by predicting their own states and correcting deviations before they become fatal. Brains are the prediction engines life evolved to do this. Consciousness is the felt experience of that predictive process.

This is a three-layer thesis:
1. **Thermodynamic layer** — Schrödinger (1944): life feeds on negentropy (negative entropy); it locally reverses entropy by importing free energy
2. **Information-theoretic layer** — Friston (2005–2022): the free energy principle formalises entropy-resistance as variational free energy minimisation; prediction error = surprise = entropy = the quantity organisms minimise
3. **Neuroscientific / phenomenal layer** — Seth (2021): consciousness is what it is like to be a brain engaged in this process; it is the subjective face of the organism's entropy-resisting generative model

## Scope

**In scope:**
- The precise mathematical and conceptual connection between thermodynamic entropy and informational free energy
- Schrödinger's negentropy argument and its modern successors
- Friston's free energy principle: what it claims, how it works, what's controversial
- Active inference: how organisms reduce surprise by *acting* (not just perceiving)
- Seth's specific use of the FEP — where he agrees with Friston, where he diverges
- Key papers, books, and reviews (primary and accessible secondary)
- Open debates and criticisms (tautology objection, pan-inferentialism, explanatory scope)

**Out of scope:**
- Full treatment of integrated information theory (separate backlog item)
- Detailed implementation of active inference models
- Clinical applications (partially covered in the interoception deep-dive)

## Hypotheses to Test

1. **The thermodynamics-information bridge is mathematical, not merely analogical.** Friston's variational free energy is formally derived from the same quantity as Boltzmann/Shannon entropy; the connection is not a metaphor.
2. **Prediction error minimisation is not optional for life — it is constitutive of life.** Any self-organising system that maintains a Markov blanket (a boundary separating it from the environment) necessarily behaves as if it minimises free energy.
3. **Seth's consciousness claim adds a phenomenal layer Friston's FEP does not.** FEP describes what systems do; Seth's beast machine adds that *some* of these systems feel something when doing it.

## Open Questions

1. Is there a crisp mathematical derivation that goes from the second law of thermodynamics all the way to the claim that organisms minimise prediction error? Or is it an analogy?
2. How does active inference (acting to reduce surprise) differ from passive predictive coding (updating beliefs)? Which is more relevant to consciousness?
3. Does the FEP entail that *any* self-maintaining system (a thermostat, a candle flame) is proto-conscious? Seth says no — what is the extra condition?
4. What are the failure modes? What would falsify the claim that consciousness is entropy-resistance?
5. How does this connect to Integrated Information Theory (IIT) — another thermodynamic/information-theoretic approach?
