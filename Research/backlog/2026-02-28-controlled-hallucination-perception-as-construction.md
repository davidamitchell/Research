# Controlled hallucination: perception as active brain construction

## Research Question

What is the evidence that perception is a generative, top-down process rather than a bottom-up readout of the world — and what are the strongest objections to Seth's "controlled hallucination" framing?

## Scope

**In scope:**
- Seth's controlled hallucination thesis and its theoretical basis
- Experimental evidence for generative/predictive perception (visual illusions, binocular rivalry, perceptual learning)
- The unification of ordinary perception with hallucination and dreaming under one mechanism
- Strongest objections (transparency of perception, naive realism)

**Out of scope:**
- Full treatment of predictive processing machinery (see separate deep-dive)
- Interoception and selfhood (see separate deep-dive)

**Constraints:** Primarily a theoretical/empirical review; no live experiments required.

## Context

Spawned from the synthesis of https://youtu.be/HYUoS0GkGCs ("Reality Is A Controlled Hallucination | Anil Seth", Essentia Foundation). The controlled hallucination framing is the central thesis of Seth's *Being You* and underpins the other concepts in the talk.

## Approach

1. Review Seth's primary formulation in *Being You* (ch. 1–3) and related papers
2. Survey key experimental evidence: rubber-hand illusion, predictive coding studies, perceptual priors
3. Identify and evaluate the strongest objections
4. Synthesise: what does the evidence establish, what remains contested?
