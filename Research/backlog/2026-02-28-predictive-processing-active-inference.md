# Predictive processing and active inference: the brain as prediction machine

## Research Question

What exactly is the predictive processing / active inference framework, how does it differ from classical feedforward models of perception, and what is the empirical status of the free energy principle as its mathematical foundation?

## Scope

**In scope:**
- Core mechanics of predictive processing: generative models, prediction error, precision weighting
- Active inference: action as prediction fulfilment, not just error correction
- Friston's free energy principle as a unifying account
- Empirical support and key objections

**Out of scope:**
- Controlled hallucination as a philosophical thesis (see separate deep-dive)
- Interoception specifically (see separate deep-dive)

**Constraints:** The free energy principle is mathematically demanding; review accessible treatments first, then evaluate technical critiques.

## Context

Spawned from the synthesis of https://youtu.be/HYUoS0GkGCs ("Reality Is A Controlled Hallucination | Anil Seth", Essentia Foundation). Predictive processing is the mechanistic backbone of Seth's account; evaluating its empirical status is prerequisite to assessing the controlled hallucination thesis.

## Approach

1. Review the canonical predictive processing framework (Rao & Ballard 1999; Clark 2016)
2. Understand Friston's free energy principle — non-technical treatment first, then technical critique
3. Survey empirical evidence for and against
4. Identify what the framework explains well and where it underdetermines
