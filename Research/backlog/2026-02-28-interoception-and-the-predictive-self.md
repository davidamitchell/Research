# Interoception and the predictive self: selfhood as bodily inference

## Research Question

What is the evidence that the sense of self emerges from interoceptive predictive processing — and what are the implications for understanding depersonalisation, emotion, and mental illness?

## Scope

**In scope:**
- Interoception: definition, neural substrates (insular cortex, anterior cingulate)
- Seth's "beast machine" thesis: selfhood grounded in homeostatic prediction
- Empirical evidence: heartbeat detection tasks, rubber-hand illusion, bodily ownership studies
- Implications for depersonalisation, anxiety, and affect regulation

**Out of scope:**
- The broader predictive processing framework (see separate deep-dive)
- Philosophical debate on the hard problem (see separate deep-dive)

**Constraints:** Requires engagement with both neuroscience and clinical/phenomenological literature.

## Context

Spawned from the synthesis of https://youtu.be/HYUoS0GkGCs ("Reality Is A Controlled Hallucination | Anil Seth", Essentia Foundation). Seth's interoceptive account of selfhood is the most empirically grounded — and most potentially clinically significant — concept in the talk.

## Approach

1. Review Seth's beast-machine account of selfhood (*Being You*, ch. 9–11)
2. Survey interoceptive neuroscience: insular cortex, heartbeat evoked potential, bodily ownership
3. Review clinical evidence linking interoceptive disruption to depersonalisation and anxiety
4. Evaluate the thesis: is interoception sufficient for selfhood, or necessary but not sufficient?
