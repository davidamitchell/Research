# AI Strategy Examples: Software Engineering Focus

## Research Question

Which organisations have published or disclosed coherent AI strategies specifically targeting software engineering, what outcomes have they measured, and what does the trajectory from AI-assisted coding (Type 2) to autonomous software agents (Type 3/4) look like in practice?

## Scope

**In scope:**
- Corporate AI strategies explicitly targeting SWE productivity: code generation, review, test generation, documentation, deployment automation
- Organisations that have disclosed SWE AI programme results with measurable outcomes (cycle time, defect rates, PR throughput, cost per feature)
- The progression from copilot-style augmentation (Type 1) through agentic builders (Type 2) toward autonomous coding agents (Type 3)
- Governance models for AI-generated code: review standards, liability, IP ownership
- NZ-relevant examples where accessible

**Out of scope:**
- Pure research papers on AI coding models (not implementation strategies)
- SWE AI tool comparisons (not a product review question)
- General developer experience surveys without strategy context

**Constraints:** Focus on implementation strategy and outcomes, not model benchmarks.

## Context

The AI strategy research item (completed 2026-02-28) used the four-type typology: augmentation, agentic builders, delegated authority agents, and fully agentic business units. SWE is the clearest near-term domain for Type 2 → Type 3 progression: AI building artefacts that are reviewed by humans (Type 2), then AI making deployment decisions within defined parameters (Type 3). Understanding which organisations are navigating this transition deliberately and what governance structures they are using is directly applicable to technology-led organisations in NZ.

The Jevons Paradox research item (completed 2026-02-28) raised the open question of whether AI reducing code production costs leads to proportional increases in code produced — the SWE AI strategy question is inseparable from that demand-response dynamic.

## Approach

1. **Survey published cases** — identify 6–10 organisations that have disclosed SWE AI strategy and outcomes. Include at least one hyperscaler (e.g., Google, Microsoft), one large financial services firm, one smaller tech company.
2. **Extract design variables** — AI system type used, human oversight model, IP and liability governance, time to measurable outcome, failure modes encountered.
3. **Governance pattern analysis** — what review and approval processes for AI-generated code are being used? What quality gates exist?
4. **Agentic SWE frontier** — document current state of autonomous coding agents (e.g., Devin, SWE-agent, GitHub Copilot Workspace) and what the evidence says about their real-world performance.
5. **NZ context** — how do NZ technology organisations (typically smaller teams, less specialised) adapt global SWE AI strategies?
