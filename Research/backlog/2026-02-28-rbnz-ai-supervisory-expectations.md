# RBNZ AI Supervisory Expectations: What Do Regulated Entities Need to Know?

## Research Question

What are the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's specific supervisory expectations for AI use by regulated entities, and how do these align with or diverge from the expectations of comparator regulators (APRA, FCA, ECB/EBA)?

## Scope

**In scope:**
- RBNZ published guidance, speeches, consultation papers, and supervisory letters referencing AI, algorithms, or automated decision-making
- Specific standards and expectations: BS11 (operational risk), BS2A (governance), Solvency Standards, any ICT risk frameworks
- Comparator analysis: APRA CPS 230 and CPG 234, UK FCA AI guidance, EBA/ECB guidance on machine learning in credit risk
- OIA (Official Information Act) request candidates if no public guidance exists
- What the gap between NZ's light-touch strategy and RBNZ's supervisory silence means for risk management in practice

**Out of scope:**
- Non-financial sector AI regulation
- Consumer-facing financial product regulation (FMA scope)

**Constraints:** Distinguish what RBNZ has published vs what is inferred from general principles. Mark inferences clearly.

## Context

The AI strategy research item (completed 2026-02-28) found that RBNZ has not published standalone AI supervisory expectations. This is a material gap for NZ-regulated banks, insurers, and non-bank deposit takers deploying AI in credit decisioning, stress testing, fraud detection, and customer-facing services.

## Approach

1. Search RBNZ website for AI, algorithm, machine learning content
2. Review RBNZ annual financial stability reports (2022–2025) for AI risk mentions
3. Search RBNZ speeches database
4. Map APRA/FCA/ECB published guidance and identify what RBNZ-regulated entities should be applying by analogy
5. Assess OIA request strategy if gap confirmed
