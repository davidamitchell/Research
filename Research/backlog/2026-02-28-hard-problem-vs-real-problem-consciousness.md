# The hard problem vs. the real problem of consciousness

## Research Question

What is the difference between Chalmers' "hard problem" and Seth's "real problem" of consciousness — is the real-problem strategy a genuine advance or a deferrment of the original question?

## Scope

**In scope:**
- Chalmers' original hard problem formulation (1995, 1996)
- Seth's real-problem reframe: characterising physical correlates of specific conscious qualities
- Philosophical responses: illusionism (Frankish), panpsychism (Goff), higher-order theories
- Whether the real problem dissolves or defers the hard problem

**Out of scope:**
- Full review of predictive processing (see separate deep-dive)
- Empirical consciousness research (relevant only as evidence, not the focus)

**Constraints:** Primarily philosophical; assess competing positions on their logical merits, not just on empirical tractability.

## Context

Spawned from the synthesis of https://youtu.be/HYUoS0GkGCs ("Reality Is A Controlled Hallucination | Anil Seth", Essentia Foundation). Seth's pragmatic reframing of the hard problem is one of the most contested moves in the talk — and in contemporary philosophy of mind.

## Approach

1. Review Chalmers' hard problem formulation and the core zombie argument
2. Review Seth's real-problem strategy from *Being You*
3. Survey key philosophical responses (illusionism, panpsychism, higher-order theory)
4. Evaluate whether the real problem is a genuine advance
