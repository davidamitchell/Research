# AI Strategy: global and NZ examples, policy frameworks, regulations, and use-case typologies

## Research Question

What do leading global AI strategies look like, how does New Zealand's regulatory and policy landscape (RBNZ, DIA, MBIE, and others) compare, and what use-case typology — from human augmentation through to fully agentic business units — best describes where organisations should focus their AI adoption efforts given their context and objectives?

## Scope

**In scope:**
- Global AI strategy examples: national strategies, corporate frameworks, and academic frameworks from major jurisdictions (USA, EU, UK, Singapore, Canada, Australia, etc.)
- New Zealand-specific examples: government strategies, agency policies, and private-sector case studies
- NZ regulatory and policy landscape: RBNZ (financial stability and prudential perspectives), DIA (digital government, privacy, trust), MBIE (economic policy, workforce, digital industry), PNZ, and any other relevant agencies or statutory bodies
- New Zealand case law relevant to AI: liability, intellectual property, privacy, employment, and contractual questions raised by automated or AI-assisted decisions
- Published policy frameworks and categorisation schemas: how regulators and standards bodies are defining, classifying, and governing AI systems
- DORA (EU Digital Operational Resilience Act) AI capability model: what it defines, who it applies to, what compliance looks like
- Use-case typology: at minimum — (1) augmentation (AI assists humans), (2) agentic builders (AI builds artefacts — code, docs, content), (3) agents making decisions (AI operates with delegated authority), (4) fully agentic business units (AI runs an organisational unit end-to-end)
- Exploit vs explore distinction: when should an organisation use AI to extract more value from known patterns (exploit) vs use it to discover new capabilities or markets (explore)?

**Out of scope:**
- Technical ML architecture comparisons (not a research-into-models question)
- Detailed legal advice or specific compliance guidance (research-grade, not practitioner-grade)
- Jurisdictions with no relevance to NZ-headquartered or NZ-operating organisations

**Constraints:** Focus on actionable strategic intelligence. Prioritise frameworks that a senior NZ leader could use to structure their own AI strategy. Flag speculative claims per speculation-control conventions.

## Context

Organisations and regulators are racing to develop coherent AI strategies. In New Zealand, multiple agencies are developing policy positions with varying degrees of coordination. At the same time, global best-practice frameworks (EU AI Act, DORA, NIST AI RMF, Singapore's Model AI Governance Framework, etc.) are maturing. Understanding this landscape — and mapping it against a clear typology of AI use cases — gives a foundation for evaluating where NZ organisations and policymakers are positioned and where the most consequential decisions lie.

The exploit/explore framing from March & Simon is particularly important here: AI strategy in an exploit mode looks very different from AI strategy in an explore mode, and conflating them leads to poor investment allocation and risk mis-assessment.

## Approach

1. **Global AI strategy survey** — Identify 6–10 exemplary national or corporate AI strategies and characterise what makes them distinctive or effective. Note which frameworks are being cited by NZ agencies.
2. **NZ regulatory mapping** — For each relevant NZ agency (RBNZ, DIA, MBIE, PNZ, and others surfaced in research), document: the agency's AI policy or strategy statement (if any), the regulatory instruments that could apply to AI deployment, and any active consultations or upcoming changes.
3. **NZ case law review** — Search for any NZ cases or tribunal decisions involving AI, algorithmic decision-making, or automated systems. Note analogous cases from Australian courts that may be persuasive in NZ.
4. **Policy frameworks and categorisation schemas** — Survey how the EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001, DORA, and any NZ-specific frameworks categorise AI risk and capability. Identify common threads and conflicts.
5. **DORA AI capability model** — Locate and summarise the specific DORA provisions and guidance on AI capability assessment. Note implications for NZ financial institutions with EU exposure.
6. **Use-case typology** — Synthesise a clear, usable typology with the four types specified plus any additional distinctions warranted by evidence. For each type: definition, indicators, example organisations, key risks, and key success conditions.
7. **Exploit vs explore** — Apply the exploit/explore lens to the typology and the NZ context. When is each mode appropriate? What signals should shift an organisation from one to the other?
